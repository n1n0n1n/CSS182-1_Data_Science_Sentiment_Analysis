**Assessment Requirements:**

  

**Written assignments (narratives, discussions, and essays):** Must include at least five cited references. References constitute 20% of the assessment grade.

  

**Programming Assignments (Codes, Models, Machine Problems):** Requires a line-by-line explanation (minimum two sentences) of how libraries, functions, and syntax work. Must include five cited references. References constitute 20% of the assessment grade.

  

**Similarity Index:** All assessments must have a similarity index of less than 20% (as determined by Blackboard SafeAssign and Turnitin) to avoid plagiarism.

  

**AI Writing Detection:** Turnitin's AI writing detection is used.

- Assessments with 0% AI writing detection are required.
- An assessment that has been proven to be written by an AI writing tool or software will result in a grade of zero for the assessment and a potential final course grade of 5.0.
- A detection of 50% or greater will be considered a breach of the academic honesty agreement.
- Refer to the Academic Honesty Agreement: [https://fs2.mapua.edu.ph/MapuaWebsite7/RO/Downloads/FM-RO-01-01_-_ACADEMIC_HONESTY_AGREEMENT.pdf](https://fs2.mapua.edu.ph/MapuaWebsite7/RO/Downloads/FM-RO-01-01_-_ACADEMIC_HONESTY_AGREEMENT.pdf)

  

**Submission Method:**

- All assessments must be submitted through Blackboard.
- Submissions via Microsoft Teams, email, or cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) will not be considered and will receive a grade of zero.
- BB course messages are also prohibited for submissions.

  

**Course Delivery:**

**Lecture Modes:** Synchronous, asynchronous, and face-to-face (F2F).

- Materials: microvideo lectures, presentations, and F2F discussions.
- Sit-ins are not permitted.

**Laboratory:** Modes: Synchronous, asynchronous, and F2F (cooperative learning/unsupervised).

**Course Communication:**

- **Blended Students:** All queries, concerns, and clarifications must be discussed in person on campus, either after class or during office hours at the SOIT Office.
- **Assessment Deadlines:** Late submissions may be accepted depending on the reason why the student missed the assessments, with a maximum score of 70% of the raw score. However, this is not a guarantee to pass. 
- "Fastbreak **submissions,"** where all assignments are submitted at the end of the term, will not be accepted.
- Refrain from using BB course messages. The instructor does not use it.

**UOX Students**

**If the course has 3 parts or 3 course outcomes:** soft deadline: end of Part 1; part 2 soft deadline: end of Part 2; hard deadline for all parts: first day of the 14th week (Monday, or as announced).

  

**If the course has 2 parts or 2 course outcomes:** Part 1 soft deadline: end of part 1; hard deadline for all parts: first day of the 14th week (Monday, or as announced).

  

- Each course part must have completed at least 60% of the assessments.
- All assessments are considered late after the soft deadline and will only have a maximum raw score of 70%. Still not guaranteed to pass the assessment.

  

**Blended/Graduate Students**

**If the course has 3 parts or 3 course outcomes:** Part 1/CO 1 hard deadline: end of Part 1/CO 1; Part 2/CO 2 hard deadline: end of Part 2; Part 3/CO 3 hard deadline: first day of 14th week (Monday, or as announced).

  

**If the course has 2 parts or 3 course outcomes:** Part 1/CO 1 hard deadline: end of Part 1; Part 2/CO 2 hard deadline: first day of 14th week (Monday, or as announced).

  

- Each course part or CO must have completed at least 60% of all required assessments. Failure to comply will result in an automatic grade of 5 on the part or on the entire CO.
- All assessments are considered late after the soft deadline and will only have a maximum raw score of 70%. Still not guaranteed to pass the assessment.

  

**Final Grade**

If a student receives an "I" (incomplete) in their final grade, they must complete the required assessments within one week of the module's summative assessment. Otherwise, the module grade will be converted to 5.0. Completion is considered a late submission.

  

- **Non-Modular Courses (Graduate, Thesis, OJT):** Soft deadlines: one week after posting of the assessment. Hard deadlines: two weeks after posting (or as announced).
- **Assessment Retakes:** Retaking submitted assessments is not permitted for grade improvement or guaranteed passing.
- **Grading Schema:** The course grading schema is based on Blackboard.
- The passing rate is 70%.
- **Failing Grades:** Failing grades (5.0) will be assigned according to Mapúa University guidelines. [https://v6.mapua.edu.ph/About/Offices/RO/Registration%20Guidelines.aspx](https://v6.mapua.edu.ph/About/Offices/RO/Registration%20Guidelines.aspx)

  

**The following raw scores will result in a 0 for the assessment.**

- 0 = AI writing detection of 50% or greater.
- 1 = No submission/content or inability to open a link/file.
- 5 = wrong/invalid submission.

  

**Posting of the Final Course grades**

Based on the guidelines provided, all students are provided with enough time to make up for any missed assessments. For course concerns and clarifications, it is **imperative** that students regularly consult with the professor within the trimester. Once the grades are posted, they will be considered **FINAL and ABSOLUTE**.
